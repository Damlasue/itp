# Think Phyton Chapter 1:
## What I knew: 
* That the most important skill for a computer programmer is to be able to problem solve (Since you mentioned it in class :), being able to come up with creative solutions and being able to express the solution clearly. 
* Also I didnt know that these exact things were needed but I had an idea about this, that generally to be able to program you'd need to be able to have input, output and math.  
## What I Learned:
* I learned what a print statement is. Its when you code the function print, you are telling the computer to display or "print" the text written inside the parentheses. The example to this would be:  **>>> print('Hello, World!')** would show up as **Hello World!** on display!

# Think Phyton Chapter 2:
## What I knew: 
Syntax error: I knew what Syntax error meant but I didnt know there were 3 types of errors you could encounter. 
## What I Learned:
* For mathematical operators, Python follows the acronym PEMDAS. Parentheses, Exponentiation, Multiplication, Division, Addition and Subtraction.
 AND Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right (except exponentiation).
