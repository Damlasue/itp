**Think Phyton chapter 10
# 1 thing I knew: 
I knew that one way to make a list is to use square brackets ([ and ])!


# 1 thing I didn't know:
I did not know that you could use delete as a function, it simply makes things easier. (When you pass a list to a function, the function gets a reference to the list. If the function modifies the list, the caller sees the change. For example, delete_head removes the first element from a list:)
Example listed from article:
>>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> delete_head(letters)
>>> letters
['b', 'c']

I also didnt know that lists were mutable! thats cool!
