# Think Phyton Chapter 3:
## What I knew: 
* I knew that using functions can make a program smaller and eliminates repitition so that if you want to make a change you can easily make it in one place and that dividing a long program into functions would make it much easier to debug. code. I also kind of knew that debugging is kind of like being a detective or a surgeon in a way, since you're trying to identify what went wrong where, kind o f like putting the code through an X-ray to see what might have been the issue. 
## What I Learned:
* In this chapter most of what I didnt know was the glossary section since we talked about much of the other subtopics in class. I learned what terms such as; return value, module, void function, fruitful function, import statement and dot notation.

# Think Phyton Chapter 5:
## What I knew: 
I knew what a boolean expression means since you talked about this a lot in class. :) its when an expression is either true or false. For example (x != y    therefore   # x is not equal to y)
## What I Learned:
* I learned what floor division and modulus means. Floor division and modulus usually comes in handy in situations where you want to convert minutes into hours. Floor division divides two numbers and rounds down to an integer. But this is generally not super useful because it basically tells you how many 60 minutes are in your given minutes, so for example a 126 minute movie should convert to 2 hours and 6 minutes, however the floor division would tell you theres 2 hours and would leave out the 6 minutes. So using modulus is a better way of going about the problem in this instance which divides two numbers and returns the remainder.
