Hi Rachel!
I hope you're doing well :)

This project was kind of similar to the pyramid project we did with phyton but because the language in javaScript is different, I had to actually do a little bit more research but certain aspects of my previous code from the pyramid like using the "/n" to create space between the lines was similar so I did incorporate that into my code!

So for my chessboard I used this video I found on youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQLAbcodzqA" as a reference. I knew how to set the gridWidth, however, I was struggling with the gird height and how to make the two work together, so I used the code that this video uses, which is the ".repeat " function.

 I set my pattern1 and pattern2 to have an etra " " space added to them so that I could get the look of the chessboard, however, it was a struggle to set a condition. Even though I was able to set a promt that asks how big the chessboard should be, I was struggling to set the "else&if" conditions to actually get the size and the height of myu chessboard to change. So my code right now can only print a 4by 8 chessboard and thats why my prompt is choose from 8-8 :/ 

So i had the idea of doing this:
if (size > 8) {
    console.log ("Too Big!!");
} else if (size = 8) {
    console.log(X)
}
But I was having trouble understanding what to put into the code instead of the X there ^ because every time I tried to call getgrid or gridwidth or result, it gave me an error :( 

So this is as far as I got!
Thank you,
Damlasu.
