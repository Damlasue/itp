Phase 1: I made two circles and a triangle to make a heart on my grid
phase 2: I put that into the draw code by using x,y coordinates for the ovals and the xy coordinates for the triandgle's points. by trial and error i was able to get my heart.
Phase 3: I typed in 2 drawobjects with the where and the scale diameter. 
Phase 4: I defined my own function called the drawGrid(gridSize): so that I could make my 400 by 400 looking square divided into as many grids as I want.
